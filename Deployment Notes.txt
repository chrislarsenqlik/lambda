System pre-requisites / suggestions:
This prototype has been tested with June 2017 release of Qlik Sense Desktop
Don't have the apps active and open while using the mashup, the sessions can step on each other, this is more a problem in desktop as engine api sessions are not authenticated/by user
This more simplistic example does not connect to Kafka, looking at the SmartNodeServer.js code you can see that it has the capability if turned on
Browser refresh may be necessary to reestablish engine api session from time to time. I think I know what can be done to fix this but not 100% sure.
This was built using qSocks javascript wrapper for the QIX Engine API. Enigma.js is the newer release put out specifically by Qlik. It is on my list of todos to convert to Enigma.

Realtime Lambda implementation Deployment Instructions:
1. Move the apps in the Apps folder to Qlik Sense Apps folder
2. Move the extensions (one mashup, one extension) in the Extensions folder into the Qlik Sense Extensions folder
3. Create a new folder on the system this will run on (best to do it on the localhost that runs Qlik Sense Desktop, but if you decide to run it against Server, changes will need to be made for QSocks connection and the socket.io and rest endpoint clients in the app and extensions.), and copy the files from the Node Scripts folder into there.
4. Copy the 3 files in the "Node Scripts" folder into the aforementioned folder
5. Open a cmd prompt, enter the working directory above, and run "npm install". It will install all required npm modules

Instructions to run the demo:
1. Within the node folder in point 3 above, run "node SmartNodeServer". This will start the Qlik Orchestrator / Kafka consumer
2. Start Qlik Sense Desktop and login to get to the hub
3. Open web browser and open the mashup: http://localhost:4848/extensions/RealtimeNew/RealtimeNew.html
4. Start the data generation bot by running "node SensorClient" in the same folder
